# Pollution_US
## Overview of the project
- We created a study to predict pollution trends in different cities in the US.The pollution status was observed using the Air Quality Insex(AQI). Our data was acquired from a CSV file that contained different element AQI's namely; Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide. We displayed the highest and lowest populated cities. 

**Purpose**
- To succesfully predict pollution trends in coming years. Using the data provided over the years, we can deduce a trend that will occur for coming years.
