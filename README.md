# Air Pollution in the US. 
## Overview of the project.
- Created a study to predict air pollution trends in different cities in the US. Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants in the air that are harmful to humans and the environment. The pollutants studied were Nitrogen Dioxide(NO2), Ozone(O3), Sulfur Dioxide(SO2), and Carbon Monoxide(CO). According to the National Resources Defence Council(NRDC), four out of ten US residents live in counties with unhealthy levels of pollution. The Air Quality Index is used for to predict pollutant levels in the air by calculating in unit; microgram/cubic meter(ug/m3) and parts per million(ppm). 

## Purpose.
- The data we acquired was in form of a csv file that contained different cities AQI levels everyday for a whole year. The most harmful pollutant is CO, we focused on this pollutant to evaluate pollutions trends. Using this data, we were able to display the trend over time and ultimately predict upcoming pollution trends. We displayed the cities with the highest and lowest levels.
