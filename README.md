# Pollution_US-
## Overview of the project
- We created a study to predict pollution trend in different cities in the US. Using the Air Quality Index(AQI), we were able to display the pollution status. Our data was acquired from a CSV file that contained different elements AQI's namely; Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide. For it to be classified as pollution, the AQI has to be atleast 100. We displayed the highest and lowest populated cities.
