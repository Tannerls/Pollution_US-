# Pollution_US-
## Overviw of the project
- We created a study to predict pollution trend in different cities in the US. Using the Air Quality Index(AQI), we were able to display the pollution status of different cities in the US. Our data was acquired from a CSV file that contained different elements AQI's namely; Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide. For it to be classified as pollution, the AQI has to be atleast 100.
